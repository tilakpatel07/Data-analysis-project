    - Start with SQL and Python. They are high-demand, high-paying skills that serve as a strong foundation.
    - Learn Excel for basic analysis, as it's still a commonly required tool.
    - Complement your skillset with Tableau or Power BI for data visualization, as they are in demand and boost salary prospects.
    - Consider R or SAS if you're targeting specialized roles in statistical analysis.
    - Focus less on skills like Word and PowerPoint, as they are less impactful for career growth in this field.



# What I learned 
- This project was my first step into the world of data analysis, and it proved to be an incredible learning experience. Here are the key takeaways from this project:

- Python for Data Analysis:
    - I learned how to use Python as a powerful tool for analyzing and processing data. This included exploring datasets, manipulating data structures, and performing complex operations efficiently.

- Pandas Library:
    - I discovered the capabilities of the Pandas library for data cleaning, transformation, and manipulation. Tasks such as handling missing data, merging datasets, and performing group-by operations became manageable and intuitive.

- Data Visualization:
    - With Matplotlib and Seaborn, I learned to create compelling visualizations to uncover patterns and insights from the data. Understanding the importance of presenting data visually was a key highlight.

- Practical Problem-Solving:
    - This project introduced me to the process of tackling real-world data problems. From identifying the goal of the analysis to deriving actionable insights, I learned how to think critically and systematically.

- Foundations in Data Analysis:
    - As my first project, it provided me with hands-on experience and a foundation for exploring more advanced topics in data analysis and machine learning.



# Challenges I Faced
- As this was my first data analysis project, I encountered several challenges along the way that pushed me to think critically and improve my problem-solving skills. The most significant challenge was:

- Data Extraction and Transformation:Extracting the data in the specific format required for visualization proved to be quite challenging. The original DataFrame often needed to be manipulated in multiple ways, such as filtering, grouping, pivoting, or aggregating, to get the desired subset of data for plotting.
      -This required me to:
          - Understand the structure of the DataFrame thoroughly.
          - Learn and apply various Pandas functions like groupby() and pivot().
          - Troubleshoot errors and refine the transformations to ensure the data was accurate and suitable for visualization.

- Debugging Errors:As a beginner, I faced several errors in my code, especially when chaining multiple Pandas operations. Understanding error messages and debugging step-by-step helped me gain confidence in troubleshooting and solidified my understanding of Python and Pandas.

- Plot Customization:Creating visually appealing and informative plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn was another hurdle. Adjusting plot aesthetics, adding labels, and ensuring readability required me to experiment and learn through trial and error.
