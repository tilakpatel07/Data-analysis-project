for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_job_title = df_plot_percentage[df_plot_percentage['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)
    # df_job_title.plot(kind='barh', x='job_skills', y='skill_percentage', ax=ax[i], legend=False)
    sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
    sns.barplot(data=df_job_title, x='skill_percentage', y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='skill_percentage', palette='dark:b_r', legend=False)
    ax[i].set_title(f'{job_title}')
    ax[i].set_ylabel('')
    ax[i].set_xlabel('')
    ax[i].set_xlim(0, 100)
    if i != 2:
        ax[i].set_xticks([])

    for idx, val in enumerate(df_job_title['skill_percentage']):
        ax[i].text(val + 1, idx, f'{val:.0f}%', va='center')
    


fig.suptitle('Likehood of a skill being required for the top 3 job titles in the United States')
fig.tight_layout()
plt.show()
